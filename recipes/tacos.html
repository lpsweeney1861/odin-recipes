    <h4>How it's done</h4>
    <p>This is a quick and easy recipe that Conor Sweeney learned from his mother. The first step is to break apart your ground turkey in a
    well-oiled pan and cook until browned. Once browned, add your taco seasoning and 1/2 cup of water. Cook for a few more minutes. 
    At this point you should be heating up your crunchy taco shells in the oven. Once those are done, you're good to go. Add the turkey
    and toppings of your choice. Voila.
